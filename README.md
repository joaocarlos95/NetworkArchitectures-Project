The network configuration uses protocols like OSPFv2, OSPFv3, DHCP and other mechanism like VLAN, NAT and DNS (implemented through a Virtual Machine) 
  1. The second part is to improve the previous solution with features selected by the student such as Generic Routing Encapsulation IPv6 and Multiprotocol BGP for IPv6
